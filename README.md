# React Quiz

React Quiz is a simple web application that helps users test their knowledge of the ReactJS library. The quiz consists of 15 questions, and upon completion, the result is displayed as a percentage with the option to retake the quiz. In a future update, users will also be able to review a list of all answered questions, both correct and incorrect.

- The project uses TypeScript in order to improve my knowledge of type safety and ensure more reliable code.
- CSS modules are used throughout the application in order to maintain modular and reusable styles.

## Future improvements

- Instead of loading data directly from a JSON file, I aim to fetch it from an API to simulate real-world scenarios and improve my experience with asynchronous data handling in React.
- Add various difficulty levels for the quiz.
- Use local storage to save quiz results.
